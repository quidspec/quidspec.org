title: Invalid Core QUID Versions
description: What constitutes an "invalid" value for the core pentet in QUID, and how to handle it.

It's safest if you just don't use:

- 0 or Z for anything other than [extents](/spec/extents)
- 1-7
- C or D
  - that's inherited from UUIDv4
- E or F
- M, N, P, or Q
- W, X, or Y


More on each of these forthcoming from my drafts.s
